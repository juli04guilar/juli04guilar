# 👋 Hi there, I'm Julio Aguilar!

Welcome to my profile!

## 🚀 About Me

👨‍💻 Senior Software Engineer | 10+ years of squashing bugs and shipping code.

🌐 Full-stack by trade, problem-solver by habit. From designing architecture to debugging that one weird bug in production (you know the one), I’ve been there.

🧭 Experienced tech lead: mentoring engineers, aligning with stakeholders, and occasionally translating “just a small change” into three sprints of work.

💬 Fluent in AWS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React.js

## 🔧 Projects & Contributions

🔒 Private Contributions – Most of my work is in private repositories due to NDA restrictions. I develop scalable React.js components, write unit tests using Jest, Enzyme, or other testing frameworks, and contribute to front-end architecture. I mentor junior developers and lead initiatives to migrate legacy systems to microfrontend architectures. Additionally, I develop RESTful APIs using serverless architecture on AWS to support key business functionality.  
Tech stack: React.js, Node.js, AWS, DynamoDB, Splunk, Cognito.
