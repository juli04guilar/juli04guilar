# 👋 Hi there, I'm Julio Aguilar!

Welcome to my profile!

## 🚀 About Me

👨‍💻 Senior Software Engineer | 10+ years of squashing bugs and shipping code.

🌐 Problem-solver by nature. From crafting seamless user experiences to hunting down elusive rendering bugs (yes, that one), I’ve tackled challenges across the stack. Whether it's optimizing performance, architecting maintainable codebases, or wrangling complex state logic, I'm all in—committed to building reliable, scalable, and user-centric software.



🧭 Experienced tech lead: mentoring engineers, aligning with stakeholders, and occasionally translating “just a small change” into three sprints of work.

💬 Fluent  JavaScript/Typescript,  ECMA ES6 , Node.js, and React.js, AWS SNS, AWS SQS, AWS S3 bucket, Dynamo DB.

## 🔧 Projects & Contributions

🔒 Private Contributions – My work is primarily within private, enterprise-grade codebases under strict NDA constraints. I contribute to front-end architecture, lead initiatives to modernize legacy systems through microfrontend migrations, and actively mentor junior developers to elevate team performance.

On the back end, I build secure and efficient RESTful APIs using serverless technologies on AWS, leveraging services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Cognito to support critical business functionalities. I also implement robust testing strategies using frameworks like Jest and Sinon, Chai, ensuring code quality and long-term maintainability.
